# Aliens-Mini-Game
# Welcome brave player!
The world has suffered an invasion! After a ship crashed in the middle of a large metropolis, hideous, flesh-thirsty creatures spread and bred in the subway's underground tunnels. Now the city is infested and part of the population has been evacuated.
Your mission, soldier, is to enter one of the nests that holds a terrible monster. Dozens of soldiers were destroyed by passing nearby. But you, warrior, will not fail! That's why I called you here. You are one of the best and you will be able to defeat the beast with large claws that defends one of the main underground nests.
We need you to lead the way! Be the tip of the spear!
This is the first mission. The next one depends on your success in this one. We have the city to win back. The siege won't last long against the aliens' attacks! Let's fight!!!

# #1 Mission: Defeat Razor Claws at the subway!
The first mission and part of the second are available for you to play! The executable file of the project (.jar) is in the release menu. Version 2.0.

The project was entirely developed in Java. The GUI toolkit widget used to build the graphical part was Java Swing. That's right!.. How did I do that? With a lot of development and a completely new logic! There were many months of study, research on forums and topics discussed with Chat GPT... and I finally finished the first part of the project. If you want to study the code, feel free. All classes are available here in this GitHub repository. If you have suggestions for improvements, please contact me.

# Inspirations for this java game:
This game makes clear references to games from the 80s-90s. So there are many details that refer to SNES games like Alien vs Predator (1993), Alien vs Predator Arcade (1994), Castlevania Dracula X (1995), Demon's Crest (1994)... and more. Songs, original game sprites... All graphic parts come from the work of third parties. But the creation of the entire scenario is mine.

## üíª Software development
This development required a lot of field research, as most of this information, such as the class to play music in java, or the Timer class, is not very evident in the research forums. This makes many unaware of these possibilities. But here we can know more about it.
## üë®‚Äçüéì Contributing to the development
I'm posting this code so that you can learn a little more about Java development and also give me feedback so that I can continue to evolve. In this way, the knowledge acquired in these classes can continue to circulate and also reveal to other developers the possibilities that the language can offer.
