# Aliens-Mini-Game
# Welcome!
The game presented in this repository was developed by Gustavo Costa de Andrade, a student of systems analysis and development.
## 🔍 From dreams to reality: Several gamers have dreamed of creating their own games, and here's one that is working to make it a reality...
Since I was little, I have always been enchanted by the universe of games. I see these narratives as parallel worlds that we can access and venture into. Game developers are true creators of worlds. They take into account not only the programming logic, but also the music, the scenarios, the story of each character and their personal motivations... These are details and elements that transform the story presented into a mirror of verisimilitude of our human reality, adding a touch of the fantastic.
## 🚀 Innovating with simplicity
In fact, this application is considerably simple from a development point of view, if compared to some large and already completed projects like "Minecraft" for example, but I see that to get there it is necessary to climb some steps. The development of this project helped me to see beyond these possibilities and I was able to learn new technologies within Java itself. Here is the video I produced to explain a little more about the project:

## 💻 Software development
This development required a lot of field research, as most of this information, such as the class to play music in java, or the Timer class, is not very evident in the research forums. This makes many unaware of these possibilities. But here we can know more about it.
## 👨‍🎓 Contributing to the development
I'm posting this code so that you can learn a little more about Java development and also give me feedback so that I can continue to evolve. In this way, the knowledge acquired in these classes can continue to circulate and also reveal to other developers the possibilities that the language can offer.
